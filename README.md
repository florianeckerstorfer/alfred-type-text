# Type Text Alfred Workflow

> Workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to type a given text or the clipboard into the focused text field.

Made by 👨‍💻 [Florian Eckerstorfer](https://florian.ec) in 🎡 Vienna, Europe.

Occasionally you encounter a text field you can't paste text into. For example, some websites disable pasting into the _email confirmation_ input field. This Alfred workflow takes the clipboard or a given text and types it into the currently focused text field using Apple Script.
